# Hi, There 🤙

I am Tanay, From India. I have been been interested in Coding and Biology at the same time and was confused but after some time I bit the bullet and opted for Bachelor's in IT and the journey till now is amazing.
I love to see people who are on the same road sharing content online like setups, coding setups, their environment motivates me a lot. 

### Devices 🎬
I like to distro hop sometimes but not environment hop. I like the design language of Gnome and I have been using it since I discovered it. I mainly use Majaro.
